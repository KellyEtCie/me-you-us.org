The Institute of Social and Emotional Education (ISEE) team has over a decade of experience teaching Social Emotional Learning (SEL) which includes essential skills such as emotional literacy, self-kindness, attention development, cooperation, effective communication and conflict resolution.
<br/><br/>
Our objective is to help develop healthy relationship skills and engaged citizenship.
<br/>
We do this by cultivating compassion and connectedness through targeted application of SEL principles in the three domains of <b>ME</b>, <b>YOU</b>, and <b>US</b>.
