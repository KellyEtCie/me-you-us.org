The Institute of Social and Emotional Education (ISEE) team has over a decade of experience teaching Social Emotional Learning (SEL) as well as essential skills such as emotional literacy, self-kindness, attention training, mindfulness, effective communication and conflict resolution. Our objective is to help develop healthy relationship skills and help the development of engaged citizens.
<br/><br/>
We do this by cultivating compassion and connectedness through targeted application of SEL principles in the three domains of  <b>ME</b>, <b>YOU</b>, and <b>US</b>.
