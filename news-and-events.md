<h3>Cultivating Compassion</h3>
In ourselves, and the communities where we live and work
</div>

Description: What is compassion and how do we cultivate it in ourselves, and in the communities where we live and work? Join us to learn some strategies that you can begin to use immediately. When you choose to practice compassion—not just talk about it and think about it but actually commit to it—your relationship with yourself and others will change, your anxiety and depression will decrease, and you will simply feel better. This public lecture will be lead by Dr. Tara V. Wilkie, Ph.D, psychologist and co-founder of the Institute of Social Emotional Education.
